\chapter{Vulnerabilities in Software Applications}
\label{chapter:vulnerabilities}
  Software vulnerabilities and exposures are weaknesses or flaws in software products that are
  exploitable in a~cyberattack. The exploitation of a~vulnerability can allow an attacker unauthorized
  access, elevation of privileges or denial of service~\cite{SoftwareVulnerabilities}.
  Most of the known vulnerabilities are associated with dealing with input provided by a~user
  of the application. For instance, some frequent types of vulnerabilities include buffer overflows,
  cross-site scripting, and SQL injections~\cite{vulnerabilities}. The mistakes causing these issues
  can be introduced during the development process or by using insecure libraries and frameworks.

  This chapter discusses general ways to improve the security of software applications in the beginning.
  Subsequently, identifiers related to evaluating vulnerabilities and public databases storing details about them
  are described. At the end of this chapter, a~real-world example of a~cyberattack and its consequences
  are presented in order to introduce the severity of this topic.

  \section{Prevention and Mitigation}
  Preventing and mitigating software vulnerabilities is crucial for ensuring the security and reliability
  of developed software. This section presents some secure coding practices for the prevention
  and mitigation of weaknesses being introduced during the development of a~product.
  \textit{Following subsections are based on~\cite{SecureCodingPractices}.}

  \subsection*{Input Validation and Sanitizing}
    An input of an application or service can have different sources which can be divided based on trustworthiness.
    For example, internal communication between services might be considered a~trusted source. On the other side,
    Input from a~user is considered to be an untrusted source because the data received can be anything.
    This makes it important to validate it properly, so that malformed input will not harm the system or lead
    to unexpected behaviour. An~example of insufficient validation are SQL injections. To improve input
    validation these points should be considered:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item check all inputs from untrusted sources
      \item check usage of proper character sets (UTF-8, ASCII, ...)
      \item encode data to a~common character set before validation
      \item validate all received data for type, length, format, and range
      \item validate received data against a~``white'' list of allowed characters, when possible
      \item process special and hazardous characters with increased precision to address double encoding or other
            forms of obfuscation attacks
      \item all validation failures should result in input rejection
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection*{Output Encoding and Sanitization}
    When it comes to a~trusted source of messages between services, some checks might be omitted as internal
    communication can be performed through an internal interface. Omitting some validations, in this case,
    could result in better performance of the system. To achieve this goal it is essential to comply with
    all items mentioned in the previous subsection, so the exchanged messages should be correctly encoded
    and sanitized. Sanitizing should be mainly done on data for operating system commands and queries
    for SQL, XML, and LDAP.

  \subsection*{Authentication and Password Management}
    Authentication is a~process of validating the identity of a~user, device, or system. It is used for
    ensuring restricted access to private resources or certain actions. Some authentication methods
    are:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item passwords -- typically used in combination with a~user name
      \item two-factor authentication (2FA) -- this method requires two different forms of authentication
            to validate identity
      \item biometric authentication -- this type requires physical or behavioural actions, like
            face recognition or fingerprint, for identification
    \end{itemize}
    By implementing strong authentication methods into the system, organizations can prevent identity theft
    and provide protection against unauthorized access. These are some practices on implementation, configuration
    and password management improvement:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item require authentication for all resources, except for those intended to be public
      \item authorization should be fail secure
      \item credentials should be stored only as cryptographically strong one-way salted hashes of passwords
            and storage should be writeable only by the application
      \item validate authentication only on completion of all input fields, especially in case of sequential
            authentication
      \item use only HTTP POST request for sending authentication data
      \item enforce higher password complexity -- length, numeric and/or special characters
      \item enforce account disabling after a~number of failed login attempts, the duration should
            be sufficient to discourage guessing credentials by brute-force attack, but not to allow
            denial-of-service attack
      \item notify the user on password change
      \item allow next password change at least after one day from the last change
    \end{itemize}

  More advice on secure coding practices can be found in~\cite{SecureCodingPractices}. Nevertheless, mistakes
  tend to slip into production versions of software. At this stage, other options are to use vulnerability
  scanning tools, write automated tests or perform penetration testing to discover hidden weaknesses, before
  they are exploited. Scanning tools are a~form of static analysis. They work by searching the application's
  code/binary for vulnerable patterns. Details of such tools are analysed in the next Chapter
  \ref{chapter:clonedVulnerabilities}. Automated tests and penetration testing are forms of dynamic analysis.
  They discover run-time issues in the built and running application or its parts.

  \section{Identifiers Related to Security Vulnerabilities}
  This Section introduces identifiers which are used to evaluate and address vulnerabilities and the most popular
  publicly available databases storing records about disclosed weaknesses.

  \subsection*{CPE -- Common Platform Enumeration}
    CPE refers to a~standardized method for describing and identifying abstract classes of software
    and hardware products present in an organization's computing infrastructure. The standard was created
    by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as~the part of the Common Vulnerabilities
    and Exposures (CVE) program. The latest version of CPE is~2.3 and is used to identify products
    in vulnerability databases. It is represented as formatted string binding with colon-delimited
    list of components prefixed with the string ``\texttt{cpe:2.3:}''~\cite{CPEnaming}.\\
      \centerline{\texttt{cpe:2.3: part : vendor : product : version : update : edition :}}\\
      \centerline{\texttt{language : sw\_edition : target\_sw : target\_hw : other}}
    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
          \hline
            Item & Description & Example \\
          \hline
            part & Class--\textbf{a}pplications, \textbf{o}perating systems or \textbf{h}ardware devices & o \\
            vendor & Identifies manufacturer of the product & microsoft \\
            product & Name of the product & windows\_10 \\
            version & Affected release version & 1.0 \\
            update & Affected update & beta \\
            edition & Edition-related terms applied by the vendor & datacenter \\
            language & Localization of the product & en-us \\
            sw\_edition & Software edition & professional \\
            target\_sw & Software environment of the product & django \\
            target\_hw & Hardware environment of the product & x64 \\
            other & Custom or vendor-specific information & attr:value\\
          \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Overview of CPE components.}
        \label{tab:my_label}
    \end{table}

  \subsection*{CWE -- Common Weakness Enumeration}
    CWE is a~community-developed formal list of common software and hardware weakness types that
    have security ramifications, which was released in 2006. The CWE database is maintained by the MITRE Corporation
    and as of 28th December 2022, it contains 933~records. The main goal of CWE is to stop vulnerabilities
    at the source by educating software and hardware architects, designers, programmers, and acquirers
    on how to eliminate the most common mistakes before products are delivered~\cite{CWE}.

    The severity of weaknesses can be evaluated by Common Weakness Scoring System (CWSS). It provides a~method
    for prioritizing software weaknesses. It is a~collaborative, community-based effort that is addressing
    the needs of its stakeholders~\cite{CWSS}.

    \noindent Current top three weaknesses are~\cite{CWEtop25}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{CWE-787} -- Out-of-bounds Write
      \item \textbf{CWE-79} -- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (``Cross-site Scripting'')
      \item \textbf{CWE-89} -- Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (``SQL Injection'')
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection*{CVSS -- Common Vulnerability Scoring System}
  CVSS captures technical characteristics of software, hardware and firmware vulnerabilities. It attempts
  to assign severity scores to vulnerabilities. The score is in the range of 0.0 -- 10.0, where higher numbers represent
  more severe vulnerabilities. The metric is composed of three metric groups -- base, temporal and environmental --
  and helps with the prioritization of vulnerabilities~\cite{CVSSFirst, CVSSresearchgate}.

  \section{Vulnerability Databases}
  % https://wiww.researchgate.net/publication/316971384_Analyzing_Vulnerability_Databases
  In 1989 the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) was established at the Software Engineering Institute
  at Carnegie Mellon University to find, collect and publish all information about known vulnerabilities.
  After CERT displayed all collected vulnerabilities publicly, they started to appear in many new databases
  with different formats of weakness information. The most popular vulnerability databases were analysed
  in~\cite{VulnDBs}, but as of December 2022, some of them are shut down or not maintained.

  \subsection*{CVE -- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures}
    CVE is a~list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. It was released in 1999, at a~time when
    most cybersecurity tools used their own databases, names and evaluations of weaknesses. Now, CVE provides
    a~database and a~unified standard for naming information security vulnerabilities.

    The process of creating a~new CVE identifier begins with discovering and reporting a~potential security
    vulnerability. The information is accordingly assigned a~unique CVE identifier by a~CVE Naming Authority
    (CNA) and posted to the list on the CVE website by an editor. The MITRE Corporation functions as the editor
    and primary CNA~\cite{CVE}.

    Each entry in the list contains the following fields: CVE identifier number, brief description and references.
    The CVE identifier number format looks like ``\texttt{CVE--YYYY--NNNN}'', where
    ``\texttt{Y}'' refers to a~year of creation and ``\texttt{N}'' is unique number assigned to the vulnerability.
    As~of 29th December 2022, the database contains 191\,855 CVE records\footnote{\href{https://cve.mitre.org}
    {https://cve.mitre.org}} and is synchronized with the following database.

  \subsection*{NVD -- National Vulnerability Database}
  \label{section:nvd}
  The NVD was established in 2005 to provide the U. S. government with a~repository of data about software
  vulnerabilities. It is a~product of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to provide
  vulnerability management information. The NVD can be used to prioritize the vulnerabilities to address
  in order to secure important systems.

  The database is based on and synchronized with the CVE list and enhances the base CVE scheme for vulnerability
  severity metrics and updates them when new information about the vulnerability is provided. CVSS is used
  for evaluation and helps to understand the potential severity of each vulnerability. NIST works directly
  with vendors and researchers to assure the quality of published information and provide the public with accurate
  scoring data~\cite{NVD}.

  Information about vulnerabilities is accessible to the public via the web page or REST API provided
  by the organization. As~of 29th December 2022, the database contains 203\,312
  records\footnote{\href{https://nvd.nist.gov/general/nvd-dashboard}{https://nvd.nist.gov/general/nvd-dashboard}}
  providing the following data:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Base CVE Entry Schema -- Identification, Description, References
      \item Source Identifier -- Reporter
      \item Publication Time
      \item Last Modification Time
      \item Status
      \item Metrics -- CVSS
      \item Weaknesses -- contained CWEs
      \item Configurations -- CPE
  \end{itemize}

  \section{Real-world Example of Exploitation}
  The consequences of vulnerabilities in software applications can be quite serious like data breaches,
  theft of sensitive information, or damage to a~product infrastructure. For instance, consider
  vulnerability, in Microsoft Windows implementation of Server Message Block protocol, with an identifier
  CVE-2017-0144\footnote{\href{https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0144}{https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0144}}.
  An exploitation of this flaw, by sending crafted packets, allows remote attackers to run
  arbitrary code on a~target machine. This defect facilitated the spreading of worm-like ransomware
  \emph{WannaCry} through the network in 2017, which affected many organizations, companies,
  and individuals~\cite{WannaCry}. Figure~\ref{wannacryDistribution} depicts the spread of \emph{WannaCry} ransomware.

  % https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-an-executive-guide-to-one-of-the-biggest-menaces-on-the-web/

  Ransomware is a~type of malicious software, that locks up the victim's data or device and threatens to delete
  or keep it locked unless a~ransom is paid to an attacker~\cite{Malware}. In the case of \emph{WannaCry},
  the malware would encrypt files on the victim's device and ask for a~ransom of value 300 USD in Bitcoin
  if paid within the first three days, otherwise, the value would be doubled for the next four days and if
  not paid at all, the files would be lost forever.~\cite{wannacryBlog}
